# Chat-Spam-Bot

Before running the program, make sure *pyautogui* and *keyboard* modules are installed.\
To install them, enter these commands in terminal
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## How to execute the program?
Run this command in your terminal

```
python main.py
```

To change the Fail Safe Key (which is "q" by default) of the program, open *main.py* and change the following variable
```python
SAFE_KEY = "[input your key here]"
``` 
For example if one wants the Fail Safe Key to be "x", we make the following changes
```python
SAFE_KEY = "x"
```
